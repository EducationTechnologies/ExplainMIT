# ExplainMIT   [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/LingDingDong/feynman-mvp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/LingDingDong/feynman-mvp)

ExplainMIT is a website where MIT students, TAs and professors share visual explanations

## Intro

**Problem**
Help is a scarce resource. Office Hours can have long help queues. Piazza's response times can be unpredictable. Finding suitable study partners is not always possible. 

**Solution**
ExplainMIT is a website where helping one person is no different than helping everyone - because all explanations can be archived and reused.
