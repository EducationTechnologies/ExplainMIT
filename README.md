# ExplainMIT [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/LingDingDong/feynman-mvp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/LingDingDong/feynman-mvp)

explain.mit.edu is a place where MIT peers create vivid explanations to help each other 

## Problem
1. Help is a scarce resource because the time of professors, TAs and students are limited

## Solution
1. Provide an efficient collaboration platform to increase the number of peer interactions
- Peers can interact in real-time on a shared blackboard with voice chat
- Peers can record and share lightweight pseudo-videos, built to use 100x less memory

2. Explanations are by-products of peer interactions and are archived on the platform
- After a session, clicking "SAVE" will upload a silent animation of the blackboard process 
- The session can also be pre-recorded and uploaded, which works best for one-sided teaching interactions
