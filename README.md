## Intro

**Problem**
It's hard to get help from classmates. On Piazza, instructors answer 95% of the questions.

**Observation**
Nearly nobody deliberately makes explanation videos because the process is unrewarding and lacks human feedback. However, people like explaining things in person. 

**Solution**
Feynman is a system where videos are created as by-products of people explaining things to each other.
