# ExplainMIT [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/LingDingDong/feynman-mvp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/LingDingDong/feynman-mvp)

The ExplainMIT project is a website built by MIT students in order to make learning more efficient and collaborative. 

## Problem
Help is a scarce resource because the time of professors, TAs and students are limited

## Solution
We provide an efficient collaboration platform to increase the number of peer interactions. 
Peers can interact in real-time on a shared blackboard with voice chat. 
They can also record and share lightweight pseudo-videos, built to use 100x less memory.

Explanations are by-products of peer interactions and are archived on the platform. After a session, clicking "SAVE" will upload a silent animation of the blackboard process. The session can also be pre-recorded and uploaded, which works best for one-sided teaching interactions.
