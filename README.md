## Intro

**Problem**
Help is a scarce resource. Office Hours can have long help queues. Piazza's response times can be unpredictable. Finding suitable study partners is not always possible. 

**Solution**
ExplainMIT is a website where helping one person is no different than helping everyone - because all explanations can be archived and reused.
