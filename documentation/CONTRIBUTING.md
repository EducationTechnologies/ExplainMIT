## Coding style
- Don't use a linter because it causes lots of noisy changes for code review (e.g. indentation and semicolons) 
- Don't use semicolons because it doesn't improve readability (think Python) and its absence doesn't cause bugs for our stack

## Recommended setup
1. **Node and NPM**: Version 10.10.0 (we require 10.10+, version 11+ has known bugs) 
2. **Code edtior**: Microsoft Visual Studio Code 
3. **Code editor extensions**: Vetur (syntax highlighting for Vue files), PDF viewer (enables PDF to be directly previewed) 
3. **URL navigator** [Short (made by Harry Liu!)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/short/hoobjcdfefnngjeepgjkiojpcicciihc)
