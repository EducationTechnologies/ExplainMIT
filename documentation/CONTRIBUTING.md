## Coding style
- Don't use a linter because it causes lots of noisy changes for code review (e.g. indentation and semicolons) 
- Don't use semicolons because it doesn't improve readability (think Python) and its absence doesn't cause bugs for our stack

## Recommended setup
1. **Node and NPM**: Version 10.10.0 (we require 10.10+, version 11+ has known bugs) 
2. **Code edtior**: Microsoft Visual Studio Code 
3. **Code editor extensions**: Vetur (syntax highlighting for Vue files), PDF viewer (enables PDF to be directly previewed) 
3. **URL navigator** [Short (made by Harry Liu!)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/short/hoobjcdfefnngjeepgjkiojpcicciihc)

## How to contribute
1. Choose a task on [Trello](https://trello.com/b/2VdWvqBJ/explainmit) such as "Fix bug X" 
2. Create a new branch called X 
3. Use the [documentation](/documentation) folder on this repository and collaborate with us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/dypDkaq) and [ExplainMIT](https://explain.mit.edu/ExplainMIT%20Team/questions)
3. When you finish coding, create a Pull Request and await a code review
4. Voila!
